Laser Golf  Galaxies:

This is a golf game for  1-4 players to play on a randomly generated course

Controls:
	W = Increase shot force (If not at maximum)
	S = Decrease Shot force (Cannot decrease shot force to zero once it has been increased)
	A = Decrease Shot angle (Subtracts from the current shot angle. Can wrap around from 0 to 360)
	D = Increase Shot Angle (Adds to the  current shoft  angle. Can wrap around from 360 to 0)
	Space Bar = Shoot/Launch the ball
	X = While on the first turn this will add to the number of players (Max is 4)

Notes:
	The game ends when all of the players reach the end; This can make it hard to hear the sound for reaching the hole trigger. This can be resolved by
	adding a second player.
	The game has two extra credit features; Random Hole generation and multiple players.

Bug Acknowledgments:
	The game has two known errors.
	1.
		There is a purely visual bug when the ball is deflected off of rotated walls if can appear to phase through the wall before deflecting. 
		This is because the hitbox and the Wall drawn to the screen are not in alignment for all rotated rectangles.
	2.
		The ball can occasioanlly get caught inside a wall and continously collide with it. If the player allows the ball to stop and take the next turn 
		it will usually break free on the wall.
